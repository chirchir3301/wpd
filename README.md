Analysis of data showing number of farmers relative to the number of water pans from different(9) sub-counties in Kenya
plotting scatter plots
computing Pearson's product moment (r) 



Aftermath
 with the value of PCF after analysis being 0.9292032 , and the base knowledge that if It has a value between -1 to 1, with a value of -1 meaning a total negative linear correlation, 0 being no correlation, and + being poitive linear regression, we can coclude by saying that number of water pas is dependent on the number of farmers ocuupying a certain sub-county, thus positively correlated, where an increase in number of farmers consequently results to more pas being constructed.
